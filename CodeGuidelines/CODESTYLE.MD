## Codestyle

Novus codestyle allows developers to easily understand your code and gives a better chance of your code to be accepted on a pull request.

### Variable names:
We use camel case.<br>
Please use `FooBar` instead of `foo_bar`

### Functions / Statements:
We use this style:
```
if(true) {
...
}
```
Please don't do:
```
if(true)
{
...
}
```

### Code comments:

Please always comment your code in an easy way this means don't do abstractions or avoid commenting your code at all, try to keep the Novus codebase as readable as possible remember you are not the only one that wants to contribute.
