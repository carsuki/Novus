# ETHICS

Ethics are are a very important part of Polar Team, we love than every developer can get what enough credit for their job and work!.

### Crediting 

Please credit in this way when using a file or library:

```objective-c
//Special thanks to (Team/Developer name) for this (Code snippet/File/Library) I took the code from (Link to code) and their Twitter is (Twitter link, leave it blank if they don't have one)
```

#### Stack OverFlow

Please credit this way when using an Stack OverFlow answer:

```objective-c
//Start Stack OverFlow code. This code was taken from Stack OverFlow and the post is avalible here (Link to post)

if(true){
  ...
}

//End Stack Overflow code.
```

####Â Mailing Lists

Crediting mailing list is almost the same as creding an Stack Overflow post.

```objective-c
//Start mailing list reference. This code was taken from a mailing list and the post is avalible here (Link to archive)

if(true){
  ...
}

//End mailing list reference
```

#### Crediting yourself 

We as the main developers of Novus, have an advantage. All our code is auto credited by XCODE.

But when you contribute feel free to also show people what you did and what code is yours do it this way:

```objective-c
//This code was created by (You) for Novus, this helps Novus doing/Fixing (Action) feel free to check my GitHub and Twitter (Links to your social media)
```
